    BetaML.Trees module

Implement the functionality required to build a Decision Tree or a whole Random Forest, predict data and assess its performances.

Both Decision Trees and Random Forests can be used for regression or classification problems, based on the type of the labels (numerical or not). You can override the automatic selection with the parameter `forceClassification=true`, typically if your labels are integer representing some categories rather than numbers. For classification problems the output of `predictSingle` is a dictionary with the key being the labels with non-zero probabilitity and the corresponding value its proobability; for regression it is a numerical value.

Please be aware that, differently from most other implementations, the Random Forest algorithm collects and averages the probabilities from the trees, rather than just repording the mode, i.e. no information is lost and the output of the forest classifier is still a PMF.

Missing data on features are supported, both on training and on prediction.

The module provide the following functions. Use `?[type or function]` to access their full signature and detailed documentation:

# Model definition and training:

- `buildTree(xtrain,ytrain)`: Build a single Decision Tree
- `buildForest(xtrain,ytrain)`: Build a "forest" of Decision Trees


# Model predictions and assessment:

- `predict(tree or forest, x)`: Return the prediction given the feature matrix
- `oobError(forest,x,y)`: Return the out-of-bag error estimate
- `Utils.accuracy(ŷ,y))`: Categorical output accuracy
- `Utils.meanRelError(ŷ,y,p)`: L-p norm based error

Features are expected to be in the standard format (nRecords × nDimensions matrices) and the labels (either categorical or numerical) as a nRecords column vector.

Builds (define and train) a "forest" of Decision Trees.


# Parameters:
See [`buildTree`](@ref). The function has all the parameters of `bildTree` (with the `maxFeatures` defaulting to `√D` instead of `D`) plus the following parameters:
- `nTrees`: Number of trees in the forest [def: `30`]
- `β`: Parameter that regulate the weights of the scoring of each tree, to be (optionally) used in prediction (see later) [def: `0`, i.e. uniform weigths]
- `oob`: Whether to coompute the out-of-bag error, an estimation of the generalization accuracy [def: `false`]
- `rng`: Random Number Generator (see [`FIXEDSEED`](@ref)) [deafult: `Random.GLOBAL_RNG`]

# Output:
- The function returns a Forest object (see [`Forest`](@ref)).
- The forest weights default to array of ones if `β ≤ 0` and the oob error to `+Inf` if `oob` == `false`.

# Notes :
- Each individual decision tree is built using bootstrap over the data, i.e. "sampling N records with replacement" (hence, some records appear multiple times and some records do not appear in the specific tree training). The `maxFeature` injects further variability and reduces the correlation between the forest trees.
- The predictions of the "forest" (using the function `predict()`) are then the aggregated predictions of the individual trees (from which the name "bagging": **b**oostrap **agg**regat**ing**).
- This function optionally reports a weight distribution of the performances of eanch individual trees, as measured using the records he has not being trained with. These weights can then be (optionally) used in the `predict` function. The parameter `β ≥ 0` regulate the distribution of these weights: larger is `β`, the greater the importance (hence the weights) attached to the best-performing trees compared to the low-performing ones. Using these weights can significantly improve the forest performances (especially using small forests), however the correct value of β depends on the problem under exam (and the chosen caratteristics of the random forest estimator) and should be cross-validated to avoid over-fitting.
- Note that this function uses multiple threads if these are available. You can check the number of threads available with `Threads.nthreads()`. To set the number of threads in Julia either set the environmental variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` (before starting Julia) or start Julia with the command line option `--threads` (most integrated development editors for Julia already set the number of threads to 4).

  [predict(forest,x)](@id forest_prediction)

Predict the labels of a feature dataset.

For each record of the dataset and each tree of the "forest", recursivelly traverse the tree to find the prediction most opportune for the given record.
If the labels the tree has been trained with are numeric, the prediction is also numeric (the mean of the different trees predictions, in turn the mean of the labels of the training records ended in that leaf node).
If the labels were categorical, the prediction is a dictionary with the probabilities of each item and in such case the probabilities of the different trees are averaged to compose the forest predictions. This is a bit different than most other implementations where the mode instead is reported.

In the first case (numerical predictions) use `meanRelError(ŷ,y)` to assess the mean relative error, in the second case you can use `accuracy(ŷ,y)`.
